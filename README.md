# Flutter State Management with Provider 🧠

Welcome to my **Flutter-State-Management-Provider-App** repository!

## 🚀 About

This project is part of my Flutter learning journey. I'm currently exploring **state management** using the [`Provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package. 

The app is a simple **Expense Tracker** where I implement the `Provider` pattern to manage and display transactions.

> ✅ This is a practice project — not production ready — built for learning purposes.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧾 Add and list transactions
- 💡 Learn how to use `ChangeNotifier` and `Consumer`
- 📦 Implement clean and simple state management using Provider

## 📚 What I’m Learning
